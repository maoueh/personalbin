## Contributing

Well, it's my personal bin, so there is little chance you would
need to contribute to this repository. If you would like anyway,
follow the standard procedure:

1. Fork it

2. Create either a fix branch or a feature branch
 * `git checkout -b fix-(name-here)`
 * `git checkout -b feature-(name-here)`

3. Commit your changes
 * `git commit -am 'Message describing the fix or feature'`

4. Push the branch into your repo
 * `git push origin feature-(name-here)`

5. Create new Pull Request
